// Modify the ExtendedUser class (rewrite it) by adding a static match method to it. The method should retrieve the teacher object, student object, and optionally a course name. Its task is to find the match between the student and the teacher.

// In case the course name is not provided, the method should return:

// an empty array if there is no match (the teacher does not teach courses the student is interested in, or teaches courses at a lower level)
// an array with {course, level} objects, if the teacher teaches the courses the student is interested in.
// If the course name is passed as the last argument, then the method should return the {course, level} object in case of a correct match, or undefined otherwise.
