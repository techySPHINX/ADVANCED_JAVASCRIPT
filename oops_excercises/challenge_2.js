// Create a new class, ExtendedUser, that will inherit from the User class.

// Put a setter and getter named fullName in it. The getter should return the first name and last name concatenated into one string. The setter takes the concatenated first and last name *e.g. 'Rafael Fifer') and splits it into first and last name (the split method), changing the appropriate properties of the object.

// Based on the ExtendedUser class, create two more classes, Teacher and Student (inheritance). They should not have any new methods or properties, but only the default roles in their constructors to 'teacher' or 'student' respectively (i.e. their constructors will take three parameters instead of four: name, surname, and email)

class ExtendedUser extends User{
    constructor({name, surname, email, role}) {
        super({name, surname, email, role});
    }

    get fullName() {
        return `${this.name} ${this.surname}`
    }

    set fullName(fullName) {
        let names = fullName.split(' ') ;
        if(names[0] && names[1]) {
            this.name = names[0];
            this.surname = names[1];
        }
    }
}

class Teacher extends ExtendedUser {
    constructor({name, surname, email}) {
        super({name, surname, email, role: 'teacher'});
    }
}

class Student extends ExtendedUser {
    constructor({name, surname, email}) {
        super({name, surname, email, role: 'student'});
    }
